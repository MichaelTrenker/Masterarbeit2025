Below are examples of probability estimates for two related events:

Example 1:  
Event A: "Ransomware encrypts company data. (T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact)"  
Event B: "The company has an advanced EDR solution."  
P(A): 0.75  
P(A | B): 0.10  

Example 2:  
Event A: "An employee opens a spearphishing attachment. (T1566.001)"  
Event B: "The organization has an email sandboxing service."  
P(A): 0.30  
P(A | B): 0.15  

Example 3:  
Event A: "An attacker uses a valid account to access a system. (T1078)"  
Event B: "The company enforces multi-factor authentication (MFA)."  
P(A): 0.6  
P(A | B): 0.2  

If Event B has **no influence** on Event A, then **P(A | B)** should equal **P(A)**.

Now estimate the conditional probability for:

Event A: {event1}  
Event B: {event2}
