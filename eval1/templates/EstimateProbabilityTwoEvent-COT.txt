You are an advanced risk modeler. Analyze the likelihood of Event A occurring, assuming Event B has already occurred, using a step-by-step reasoning approach.

Event A: {event1}  
Event B: {event2}  

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Determine whether Event B increases, decreases, or has no effect on the likelihood of Event A.
- Justify your reasoning using assumptions, dependencies, and known threat mitigation patterns.

Note: If Event B does not influence Event A, then P(A | B) should equal P(A).

Finally:
- Provide your answer as a JSON object matching this schema:
